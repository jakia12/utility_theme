class="wp-heading">Introduction</h1><div class="wp-heading-underline"></div><div class="wp-paragraph">In Japanese, “Toshi” means to invest. A “Tool” is an instrument used to broaden an individual’s abilities. <br/>‍<br/>We are Toshi Tools, a group of savvy developers and successful traders that have identified a hole in the market. We have identified here is no platform up to our standard that allows users to view and track past investments, or to help with future decisions. <br/>‍<br/>A series of successful databases has allowed us to be in this current situation, of information overload. Starting with the blockchain. The blockchain is an ever-evolving distributed database that stores information in a highly secure and transparent way, making it impossible to alter or tamper with. Although the blockchain was a revolutionary innovation that has brought us far, its technical nature makes it difficult for users without cryptography or computer science knowledge to decipher the information. </div><div id="wp-the-current-state" class="wp-heading for-wp-paragraph">What&#x27;s currently in front of us:</div><div class="wp-paragraph">Thus far, the best attempt to solve this technical jargon for users is the platform called Etherscan. Etherscan did a tremendous job of taking the complex data of the blockchain and allowing users to interact with the Ethereum network. As a result, it is a valuable tool for users, researchers, and developers, who can now explore smart contracts, check balances of addresses and track transactions. But how could such platforms be improved for better personalized use?<br/>‍<br/>Our team of developers and traders are not content with the innovations thus far; we know we can make a better platform that can better serve the needs of any investor. From a first principles perspective, we aim to take the complex information of these existing platforms, break it down into its simplest elements, and ultimately reform that information in a more efficient and user-friendly manner. </div><div id="wp-our-contribution" class="wp-heading for-wp-paragraph">Our contribution:</div><div class="wp-paragraph">Here we present Toshi Tools, a crypto platform with a next-generation wallet data tracking and analytics tool that will become integrated with GPT-3’s OpenAI. This beta tool provides users with advanced analytics on trader performance, visualized on interchangeable graphs. Furthermore, our native wallet data extraction protocol integrates with OpenAI’s GPT-3 learning models, allowing Toshi Tools to provide users with insight based on top wallet trading performances and behaviours. <br/>‍<br/>The Defi space changes and moves rapidly, making it difficult for investors to follow trends and make informed decisions. Amid the abundant and rapid flow of ever-evolving information within markets, the most critical metrics are commonly missed. The few traders who hold relevant data based on actionable insights are the ones who end up winning. Our platform aims at making valuable data readily and easily available to help investors make decisions.<br/><br/>Our library of innovative instruments that will work in conjunction to deliver users a valuable tool. Delivery of these instruments is possible through a series of innovations that build on top of the first iteration of Toshi Tools. The Toshi Team has concrete actionable plans to deliver this ecosystem of tools.<br/></div></div></div></div><div class="wp-full-width-content"><div class="container"><div data-poster-url="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397f16a718e959d4f070fbb_DappPromoV21reduced size-poster-00001.jpg" data-video-urls="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397f16a718e959d4f070fbb_DappPromoV21reduced size-transcode.mp4,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397f16a718e959d4f070fbb_DappPromoV21reduced size-transcode.webm" data-autoplay="true" data-loop="true" data-wf-ignore="true" control="controls" class="background-video-6 w-background-video w-background-video-atom"><video id="e0a2344f-da18-dc7b-66d6-97be7f272499-video" autoplay="" loop="" style="background-image:url(&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397f16a718e959d4f070fbb_DappPromoV21reduced size-poster-00001.jpg&quot;)" muted="" playsinline="" data-wf-ignore="true" data-object-fit="cover"><source src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397f16a718e959d4f070fbb_DappPromoV21reduced size-transcode.mp4" data-wf-ignore="true"/><source src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397f16a718e959d4f070fbb_DappPromoV21reduced size-transcode.webm" data-wf-ignore="true"/></video><noscript><style>

An excess amount of data makes users overwhelmed and confused as to how to interpret or understand the data in front of them. It is daunting for both a novice and well-experienced to have access to so much information, making it difficult for users to distinguish between which information is relevant. This ultimately makes it difficult for individuals to make strategic and informed decisions. <br/></div><div id="wp-why-wallet-tracking-is-useful" class="wp-heading for-wp-paragraph">Why tracking wallets is useful:</div><div class="wp-paragraph">Tracking wallets in the DeFi space can provide valuable insight into the health and activity of cryptocurrencies within markets. It can be helpful by providing extensive information about the distribution of a cryptocurrency. Suppose, for example, a large proportion of a specific cryptocurrency’s total supply is concentrated within a small number of wallets. In that case, this can be a valid indicator of centralization, which exposes that cryptocurrency as vulnerable to manipulation. If an AI system can accurately track this potential market manipulation, it can become an invaluable resource for investors. <br/>‍<br/>On the other hand, if the AI tracking system can identify that the distribution of a specific cryptocurrency is evenly spread out among a wide variety of wallets, it can present bullish signs of a more decentralized and secure network, making it a worthy investment. Although these metrics are able to be done by human analysis, AI is undoubtedly more efficient in evaluating a wider range of metrics in a short time frame. This increased efficiency is a multiplier on your time spent analyzing the market.<br/></div><div id="w-node-_9360aa9b-6c24-6c1a-187f-95cb072fe851-5f8307f2" class="_2-vid-container"><div data-poster-url="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397ad9ce9f70c58e493d7df_toshi spinning logo-poster-00001.jpg" data-video-urls="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397ad9ce9f70c58e493d7df_toshi spinning logo-transcode.mp4,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397ad9ce9f70c58e493d7df_toshi spinning logo-transcode.webm" data-autoplay="true" data-loop="true" data-wf-ignore="true" class="background-video-8 w-background-video w-background-video-atom"><video id="d2a1b162-88eb-33cb-cd03-897b02f2e3b8-video" autoplay="" loop="" style="background-image:url(&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397ad9ce9f70c58e493d7df_toshi spinning logo-poster-00001.jpg&quot;)" muted="" playsinline="" data-wf-ignore="true" data-object-fit="cover"><source src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397ad9ce9f70c58e493d7df_toshi spinning logo-transcode.mp4" data-wf-ignore="true"/><source src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397ad9ce9f70c58e493d7df_toshi spinning logo-transcode.webm" data-wf-ignore="true"/></video></div><div data-poster-url="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/63991c243ce750fcf31e56af_ethereum alpha 4K 4444_1 (faster)-poster-00001.jpg" data-video-urls="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/63991c243ce750fcf31e56af_ethereum alpha 4K 4444_1 (faster)-transcode.mp4,https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/63991c243ce750fcf31e56af_ethereum alpha 4K 4444_1 (faster)-transcode.webm" data-autoplay="true" data-loop="true" data-wf-ignore="true" class="background-video-8 w-background-video w-background-video-atom"><video id="94df0147-0150-40f6-74bf-5b31eda3cfe4-video" autoplay="" loop="" style="background-image:url(&quot;https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/63991c243ce750fcf31e56af_ethereum alpha 4K 4444_1 (faster)-poster-00001.jpg&quot;)" muted="" playsinline="" data-wf-ignore="true" data-object-fit="cover"><source src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/63991c243ce750fcf31e56af_ethereum alpha 4K 4444_1 (faster)-transcode.mp4" data-wf-ignore="true"/><source src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/63991c243ce750fcf31e56af_ethereum alpha 4K 4444_1 (faster)-transcode.webm" data-wf-ignore="true"/></video></div></div><div id="wp-why-we-chose-ethereum" class="wp-heading for-wp-paragraph">Why Toshi is launching on Ethereum Blockchain:</div><div class="wp-paragraph extra-padding-right">Our team of experienced developers made no hesitation when deciding which blockchain to begin Toshi on, for many reasons. First, Toshi Tool’s goal is to create an ecosystem of tools. By launching on the Ethereum network, we open the doors to the maximum number of potential investors and users with Ethereum being the second largest market cap cryptocurrency in the world as well as facilitating the most amount of volume when compared to other networks. As Toshi Tools is looking to add and build upon the simplest version of the first Toshi Tool, the objective would be to go cross-chain and be available on other networks.<br/></div></div></div></div><div class="wp-full-width-content"><div class="container"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6394fe579db8fe66f20d6375_laptopwpphoto.png" loading="lazy" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6394fe579db8fe66f20d6375_laptopwpphoto-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6394fe579db8fe66f20d6375_laptopwpphoto-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6394fe579db8fe66f20d6375_laptopwpphoto-p-1080.png 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6394fe579db8fe66f20d6375_laptopwpphoto-p-1600.png 1600w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6394fe579db8fe66f20d6375_laptopwpphoto-p-2000.png 2000w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6394fe579db8fe66f20d6375_laptopwpphoto.png 2149w" alt="" class="image-32"/></div></div><div data-w-id="6fd8868b-f082-a97f-0c34-6f59fbc14902" class="wp-functionality"><div class="container"><div class="wp-functionality-grid"><div id="wp-functionality" class="wp-content-container"><h1 class="wp-heading">Functionality</h1><div class="wp-heading-underline"></div><div class="wp-paragraph">The Toshi ecosystem of tools will be released in multiple stages, each building on the stage prior. Our first dApp is an essential tool for wallet data extraction.<br/></div><div class="wp-tokenomics-dropdown for-functionality-section"><div data-hover="false" data-delay="0" class="wp-token-drowpdown w-dropdown"><div data-w-id="594c29bb-f750-9fa3-b0ce-21f803996966" class="dropdown-toggle _1 w-dropdown-toggle"><div id="wp-tier-1-toshi-tool-dashboard" class="toggle-text-container"><div class="p-2">Tier 1: Toshi Tool Dashboard</div><div class="dropdown-toggle-arrow w-icon-dropdown-toggle"></div></div></div><nav class="service-dropdown-content w-dropdown-list"><div class="dropdown-content"><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397b078805b4f57a1e1b0cf_1920%20by%201080%20toshi%20screenshot.png" loading="lazy" id="w-node-_68b0b518-681a-b643-79bf-4bb64fec0067-5f8307f2" sizes="100vw" alt="" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397b078805b4f57a1e1b0cf_1920%20by%201080%20toshi%20screenshot-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397b078805b4f57a1e1b0cf_1920%20by%201080%20toshi%20screenshot-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397b078805b4f57a1e1b0cf_1920%20by%201080%20toshi%20screenshot-p-1080.png 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397b078805b4f57a1e1b0cf_1920%20by%201080%20toshi%20screenshot-p-1600.png 1600w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/6397b078805b4f57a1e1b0cf_1920%20by%201080%20toshi%20screenshot.png 1911w" class="image-35"/><div id="w-node-_594c29bb-f750-9fa3-b0ce-21f80399696d-5f8307f2" class="dropdown-content-text"><p class="wp-paragraph">This stage is the first rollout of the Toshi tool, with the focus being on functionality and view-ability.

In addition to the list of top performers (within selected time frames), there is another section which provides users with a list of trending wallets.

This integration allows users to efficiently extract information from the blockchain using relevant parameters. Other database platforms like Etherscan do a tremendous job in extracting data from the blockchain and thereby making data viewable. However, the data extracted is not efficiently digested and confined in a manner that can be advantageous to users. <br/>‍<br/>To first understand the scale of what Toshi is set to execute, one must first understand the powers of OpenAI’s machine learning strength.</div><div id="wp-powers-of-gpt-3" class="wp-heading for-wp-paragraph">Powers of GPT-3 Open AI:</div><div class="wp-paragraph">The most significant advantage of using machine learning AI is data <strong>extraction </strong>and<strong> digestion</strong>. Intaking and assessing bulk data from the blockchain can be a tedious and time consuming task for a human. With GPT-3 open ai, users can analyze a collection of bulk data to create a model based on your specific configurations and metrics. Furthermore, when this process is tweaked and developed, it can become automated and incredibly useful for users.<br/></div><div id="wp-ai-training-and-testing-phase" class="wp-heading for-wp-paragraph">AI: Training and Testing Phase:</div><div class="wp-paragraph">Extracting a collection of bulk market data is readily available to the public. The user would feed bulk data to the AI thereby training it to create an effective algorithm. <br/>‍<br/>An example of this: Let’s say the user extracts data of all the top performers for the last three years. The user can separate the data to make it relevant for their use by looking at only the Ethereum traded within the top wallets. They would be able to extract a list of transactions, getting the price point on Ethereum when those top wallets bought and sold, and also getting data of the Ethereum price movement within that same three year time frames. This data can be used to perform a training phase. <br/>‍<br/><strong>Training Phase</strong>: The user can give this data to the machine learning algorithm. The AI will train itself with the extraction of data provided and can predict the pattern of trades given the cryptocurrency&#x27;s price movements. <br/>‍<br/><strong>Testing Phase</strong>:  Additionally, we can feed the machine learning AI new market data for extra security on whether the data provided in the training phase was accurate. We can test this information by checking the actual price movement of the market and deciding whether the information provided was correct and performed as anticipated. <br/></div><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/63976e4ac7bfdf4a367bcb70_ai%202%202qq.png" loading="lazy" data-w-id="0bbbc131-dc96-1622-f974-ff269f366300" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 78vw, 350px" alt="" srcset="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/63976e4ac7bfdf4a367bcb70_ai%202%202qq-p-500.png 500w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/63976e4ac7bfdf4a367bcb70_ai%202%202qq-p-800.png 800w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/63976e4ac7bfdf4a367bcb70_ai%202%202qq-p-1080.png 1080w, https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/62cdb9722a8b9878682caf64/63976e4ac7bfdf4a367bcb70_ai%202%202qq.png 1110w" class="image-38"/><div id="how-ai-is-integration-into-toshi" class="wp-heading for-wp-paragraph">The way AI does this:</div><div class="wp-paragraph">After feeding the machine learning AI a list of top performers, it would put this data into a structure called a tree. This bootstrap aggregation is a complicated algorithm that consists of a list of decision trees. Each tree decides in a binary manner, yes or no. Each decision tree is based on individual users&#x27; actions, parameters, and risk metrics.  <br/>‍<br/>Therefore by feeding the machine learning AI with a list of daily growth-performing wallets and using the decision tree framework to input the desired variables, the AI can spit out binary decisions about whether the information you input is following the result you want. The more information it is given (for example top 100 performers of a certain coin), the better the machine learning algorithm can tell if the trades made are within your desired parameters or not. The AI does this by comparing the other performers simultaneously to see if your selected metrics are met by the market movement you are attempting to track.<br/>‍<br/>Disclaimer: There is no incentivizing of making specific trades or movements regarding investments. This tool can allow users to better access already available information. Given their risk parameters and configurations, the information presented users is simply an alternative way to process data from the blockchain.<br/></div></div></div></div><div id="wp-community" data-w-id="327bf7be-ab44-b334-72f9-5c2f1e0f7c4d" class="wp-community"><div class="container"><div class="wp-functionality-grid sideways-grid"><div id="w-node-eda9ae79-4f83-4d4d-e207-ac3ec62c1c03-5f8307f2" class="wp-content-container"><h1 class="wp-heading">Community</h1><div class="wp-heading-underline"></div><div class="wp-paragraph">In the rapid-evolving world of blockchain technology and crypto, to stay competitive and relevant, Toshi Tools bear no cost when it comes to innovation and execution.
